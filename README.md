# Maze The Game
Console maze game written in C#, where you have to reach the "exit point" while avoiding "walls" (obstacles) and optionally collecting "bonus points" for a score boost.

The recommended console window and buffer sizes are as follows:
Width: 80
Height: 25

if you experience issues, please set your console's window and buffer sizes to the values above.

.NET Framework 4.5 is recommended for optimal functionality.
